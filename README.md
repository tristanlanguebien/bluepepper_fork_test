# What is BluePepper?

BluePepper is a pipeline application designed for 2D/3D animation studios. The project aims to achieve several key goals:

- Provide a straightforward and lean pipeline application that is easy to configure and use
- Operate independently from production trackers or elaborate online services
- Make navigation and automation efficient and simple to set up
- Strike the best balance between ease of setup and automation capabilities—you'll need basic development skills, but adding new features should be reasonably straightforward

# Core Concepts

Now that you've had a chance to test BluePepper quickly, let's dive into the details. BluePepper relies on a few key features:

- **MongoDB Server**: Contains all the documents for your project (primarily assets and shots). A document is essentially the identity card of your assets and shots—think of it as metadata that BluePepper uses for many of its features
- **Codex**: Allows you to declare all the naming conventions for your project (i.e., how files should be named, where they should be stored, which characters are allowed/forbidden). The codex uses the Python package [Lucent](https://github.com/tristanlanguebien/lucent). For more information, see the [Lucent documentation](https://github.com/tristanlanguebien/lucent)
- **Browser**: Allows you to search for files by using the database and the naming conventions together. When you select an asset and a `file kind`, you construct a file search
- **Batcher**: The task manager that executes in the background the actions you launch from the Browser. Although it's somewhat advanced to use, it's a powerful tool for running an action on hundreds of shots in a single click

Once you become familiar with these four components, a world of possibilities opens up to you!

## Database
Dans le fichier conf/database.py, plusieurs modes de connexion à une base de données mongodb sont disponibles:
- local : Certainement la meilleure option si vous voulez juste tester BigPipe, mais gardez à l’esprit que le serveur tourne en local, et seulement quand l’application est ouverte (cette option n’est donc pas adaptée pour travailler à plusieurs)

- host-port : Vous ou votre département IT pouvez mettre en place un serveur MongoDB ? cette option vous conviendra certainement.

- Si vous ne savez pas comment mettre en place un serveur mongoDB vous-même, le plus simple est d’utiliser un service en ligne qui le fera à votre place, et d’utiliser l’uri fournie via ce mode de connexion.

### MongoDB Atlas
Cette section est destinée aux utilisateurs qui ont besoin d'aide pour mettre en place un serveur mongodb. If you dont, just skip to the next section.

MongoDB Atlas propose d'heberger gratuitement une base de donnée par compte. Heureusement, nous n'avons pas besoin d'une base de donnée volumineuse, donc la version gratuite fera très bien l'affaire.
Warning : keep in mind the free offer doesnt have backups

- Créez un compte sur https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database
- Suivez les instructions de bienvenue, ou allez dans account -> organizations -> {your organization} -> All Projects -> {your project} -> Clusters -> Build a cluster
- chose the Free program
- Give your cluster a name (lets say "bluepepperDB")
- Uncheck "Preload sample dataset"
- Click "Create Deployment"
- Edit the admin password and keep it somewhere safe
- You may create an additional user, if you want to fine tune permissions (which will be in Clusters -> Database & Network Access. From here, you will be able to set the user privileges to "Read and write any database" instead of "Admin")
- Add the ip address 0.0.0.0/0, so the database can be accessed from anywhere on the internet
- Your database is up and running. 
- Now go to Connect -> Drivers -> Python -> copy the srv connection string
- Go to conf/database.py
- Set the mode to "uri"
- Paste the connection string as a value for "uri"
- save

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DatabaseSettings:
    database_name: str = "bluepepper"
    mode: str = "uri"
    host: str = "127.0.0.1"
    port: int = 27017
    user: str | None = None
    password: str | None = None
    uri: str | None = "mongodb+srv://user:password@my.server.mongodb.net"

BluePepper should now be able to reach the MongoDB Atlas database !

Feel free to create an asset and a shot in BluePepper, to see how the database is structured. You can access your database in MongoDB Atlas -> Clusters -> Browse Collections

## Configuring the Browser

As stated in the "Concepts" section, the Browser uses the database and the codex to find files. Therefore, 
The Browser's configuration actually driven by two files : conf/lucent.py and conf/app_browser.py

### Lucent Configuration

In the file `conf/lucent.py`, you can configure all the naming conventions for your project. For more information, consult the official documentation: [Lucent Documentation](https://github.com/tristanlanguebien/lucent).

### Browser Application Configuration

This configuration file defines the entire Browser interface within a single `AppConfig` object:

```python
config = AppConfig("bigBrowserMainApp")
```

#### Entities

First, you need to declare the entities you want to access (typically, assets and shots). Adding an entity automatically adds a tab to the interface:

```python
asset_entity = Entity(name="asset", collection="assets", filters=["type"])
config.add_entity(asset_entity)
```

The `collection` parameter indicates which collection in your database the Browser will query for documents. By default, BluePepper uses only the `assets` and `shots` collections, but depending on your needs, you might want to create additional entities (episodes, levels, etc.) and corresponding collections in MongoDB.

The documents in the database under the provided collection will now appear in the first column of the interface.

#### Tasks

Next, you can create tasks within your entity. Tasks are simply a way to group your file kinds to match your departments' needs:

```python
asset_modeling_task = Task("modeling")
asset_entity.add_task(asset_modeling_task)
```

The created tasks will appear in the second column of the interface.

#### Kinds

You can now populate your tasks with kinds. Kinds are essentially a way to access files that match a specific convention from your project's codex:

```python
kind = Kind(
    name="asset_modeling_workfile_blender",
    label="Workfile (blender)",
    convention=codex.convs.asset_modeling_workfile_blender,
)
asset_modeling_task.add_kind(kind)
```

Kinds will appear in the third column of the interface.

#### Actions

Contextual menu actions can be added to documents, kinds, and files, allowing you to define which specific actions can be run when you right-click on various elements of the interface.

For example:

1. Create a new file in `conf/scripts` (for example, `print_stuff.py`)
2. Create a new function in this file:

```python
def say_hello() -> None:
    print("Hello World")
```

3. Add an action that runs this function using this code:

```python
action = MenuAction(
    label="say hello",
    module="conf.scripts.print_stuff",
    callable="say_hello",
)
asset_entity.add_document_action(action)
```

When you right-click on an asset document, the "say hello" action should appear, and "Hello World" should be printed to the console when you click on it.

#### Passing Arguments to Actions

Printing "Hello World" is nice, but what if you need to pass the selected documents or files as arguments?

You can use the `kwargs` attribute with these specific keywords, which will be replaced when passed to your functions:

- `<document>`: Each of the selected documents (triggers the function once per document)
- `<documents>`: List of all selected documents (triggers the function once)
- `<document_name>`: Each of the selected documents' names (triggers the function once per document)
- `<document_names>`: List of all documents' names (triggers the function once)
- `<document_id>`: Each of the selected documents' MongoDB IDs (triggers the function once per document)
- `<document_ids>`: List of all documents' MongoDB IDs (triggers the function once)
- `<convention>`: The selected convention object
- `<path>`: Each selected path (triggers the function once per path)
- `<paths>`: List of all selected paths (triggers the function once)
- `<browser>`: The BrowserWidget object

You may wonder why there are so many similar keywords like `document` and `documents`. There's actually an important difference. Let's say you have 10 selected documents:

- Using `<document>` triggers the function 10 times, once for each document
- Using `<documents>` triggers the function only once, with the list of documents passed as an argument (assuming your function contains a loop)

The same logic applies to `<document_name(s)>`, `<document_id(s)>`, and `<path(s)>`.

#### Filtering Tasks and Actions

What if the rigging task should only appear on character assets? What if an action should only work on MP4 files? Filters have you covered.

There are two types of filters:

- `doc_filter`: Depends on the document
- `path_filter`: Depends on the path

Create a function that returns `True` if your condition is met, `False` otherwise. Here are some examples: 

```python
# Task "Rigging" will only appear if a character is selected
def is_chr(doc: dict) -> bool:
    if not is_asset(doc):
        return False
    return doc["type"] == "chr"


asset_rigging_task = Task("rigging", doc_filter=is_chr)
asset_entity.add_task(asset_rigging_task)


# Action "Open in VLC" will only appear on MP4 files
def is_mp4(path: Path) -> bool:
    return path.suffix == ".mp4"


action = MenuAction(
    label="Show in VLC",
    module="...",
    callable="...",
    kwargs={"path": "<path>"},
    path_filter=is_mp4,
)
```

What if you have both a character and a prop selected? The Browser handles this intelligently—the menu action will show, but it will only execute on documents that match your filter.

# Design Philosophy

BluePepper makes minimal use of complex software architecture, which is generally considered a best practice. However, modular architectures can be difficult to code, test, update, and deploy.

BluePepper's structure is intentionally simple: you download the source code, run the installer, and it works.

Several design choices were made to simplify BluePepper's architecture:

- **Python Configuration Files**: BluePepper could use JSON, YAML, or TOML for configuration files, but Python files unlock two important capabilities: the ability to configure BluePepper more organically (if/else statements, access to environment variables, etc.) rather than with just static values
- **One Repository = One Project**: You'll notice that BluePepper has a single `conf` folder. This is intentional. We believe that BluePepper's greatest strength is its simplicity of use
- **Minimal Use of Plugins/Entry Points**: If you want to add features to BluePepper, you simply create a new Python module, import it, and it works

These choices aim to:

- Lower the barrier to entry for development, particularly for technical directors and tech artists who may not have sufficient experience with complex software architectures
- Provide excellent development ergonomics: autocompletion at every level, easy configuration
- Reduce side effects, making it safe to deploy BluePepper to your colleagues without excessive fear of breaking something
